**Effort â†’ Time**


**Rarity Calculator**
    remove t10 from starting tier as its the max tier
    whenever selecting another tier in the drop down of starting tier, making the starting rarity of highest within that by default

    fix the layout to be 1 full row for everything:
        here's how i want the layout to be, 1 div that combines starting point / target config in 2 columns and minimum requirement within that div below Them
        put full distribution same as it was before inside single chance
        put single and multiple chances within 1 wrapper div for Them
        put the tools box and probablity box on 1 row, it should have the whole layout on 1 row as it is
        when finishing all of this, allow me to revert back if i dont like it with a prompt

**Tools & Materials**
    required materials, make the tiers into small columns instead of rows
    compress the results of each tier into 1 list insted of nested divs

**All**
