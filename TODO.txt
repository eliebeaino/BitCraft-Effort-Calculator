- spinnes side by side and bigger buttons to be easier to use especially on mobile
- the main black should be centered, it's currently off center to the right. We want to it keep responsive with the side bar depending on the width of the screenview but always keep the main block centered in the middle
- change the task & effort system for effort already done:
    it will now be split into 2 sections, we can use it as a toggle button to swap modes
        - by default we will be using creafting mode, effort already done will be named effort completed
        - 2nd mode will be effort remaining
        the calculations will run opposite of each other for the result, where crafting will deduct the effort completed, where as gathering mode will deduct the different between task effort required and effort completed as gathering mode runs backwards.
- calculate time button can be on 1 line especailly on larger screens
- results should show 2 numbers if gathering or crafting mode has any input besides 0, and it show state the difference intial time needed and remaining needed while making the bigger time needed in bigger font
- add a logo for the website matching theme and i want it to be cute
