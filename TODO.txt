**Tools & Materials**
    required materials, make the tiers into small columns instead of rows
    compress the results of each tier into 1 list insted of nested divs

**All**
make the logo placement static on all pages on the far left of page
and the light/dark mode toggle on the far right
make sure it's all responsive on mobile view
make the menu page buttons on mobile aligned to center and not clipping with the logo or the light/darkmode toggle and the rest of the page below
feel free to reduce the size of the buttons themselves slightly, they need always be on 1 row
